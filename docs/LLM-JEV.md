# LLM-JEV — measurement log

The running log of the `llm-jev` mode (docs/LLM-JEV-DESIGN.md: the full engine with the Synthesizer, the generating LLM as a
candidate source inside it, Jev localising and arbitrating, shadow lanes verifying; bench arm `--conditions llm-jev`). One dated
entry per measurement, with the numbers, the run ids and the report they come from; the design doc holds the plan and the
criterion, `experiments/results/` holds the reports. Live results only — nothing here is projected.

## 2026-09-21 — first head-to-head against the GLM generator-only baseline (HEAD 626fc40)

Report: `experiments/results/llm-jev-headtohead.md` (tool output `llm-jev-headtohead.tool.md`, `.tool-rerun.md`); probes
`experiments/results/llm-jev-probes.md`; baseline `experiments/results/glm-jev-off-baseline.md`. Records under
`bench/results/llm-jev-{smoke,quixbugs,ladder,swebench,swebench-rerun}`. Frozen worktree `.claude/worktrees/llmjev-clean`,
generator `openrouter z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`, Jev `typesafe/jev-1.13-20260917` (wire id `jev-1.13.0`), same 28 tasks, limits and
concurrency as the baseline. Spend $0.406 of a $6 cap.

Pooled (28 paired tasks):

| arm | pass | correct-by-verdict (22 cheap-test) | wall median / mean | $ total (gen + Jev) | $ / task | $ / solved | steps mean | Jev requests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| jev-off (baseline) | 19/28 | 16/22, 0 overfit (+ 3/6 SWE) | 391 s / 480 s | $0.5062 ($0.5062 + $0) | $0.0181 | $0.0266 | 10.8 | 0 |
| jev-off-tuned | not run — `src/cli/args.ts:284 CONDITIONS` rejects the arm (exit 2, $0) | | | | | | | |
| llm-sieve | not run — `src/synth/index.ts:322` throws ConfigError (not wired) | | | | | | | |
| llm-jev, as run | 22/28 | 17/22, **5 overfit** (+ 0/6 SWE) | 80 s / 126 s | $0.2704 ($0.0695 + $0.2010) | $0.0097 | $0.0123 | 3.6 | 741 |
| llm-jev, 3 Jev-outage SWE runs replaced by the re-run | 23/28 | 17/22, 5 overfit (+ 1/6 SWE) | 80 s / 114 s | $0.3024 ($0.0715 + $0.2309) | $0.0108 | $0.0131 | 3.6 | 838 |

Per suite (llm-jev vs jev-off): QuixBugs 10/10 vs 7/10 (b 3, c 0), correct 8 vs 7 (overfit detect_cycle, wrap), wall median
33 s vs 93 s (0.36×, Wilcoxon p = 0.003), $ per solved 0.20×; ladder 12/12 vs 9/12 (b 3, c 0), correct 9 vs 9 (overfit shipping,
textstats, stats), wall median 47 s vs 289 s (0.16×, p < 0.001), $ per solved 0.29×; SWE 0/6 as run (3 runs killed by Jev HTTP
503/529 at 23:31–23:34 Z) and 1/6 with the re-run vs 3/6 (b 0, c 2: sympy-11618, django-15315; both: sympy-17139 at 6m02s / 3
steps vs 25m / 13 steps), $ per solved 2.43×.

Criterion (§1.3, absolute bars pre-registered for n = 40/20/30, applied verbatim at n = 10/12/6): **failed** — QuixBugs 1 (b − c = 3
< 8; p = 0.125) and 2 (Δ +1 < +8), ladder 2 (Δ 0 < +2; overfits 3 > 1), SWE 1 (c = 2, b = 0) and 4 ($ per solved 2.43× > 0.75×);
**passed** — ladder 1, wall 3 on QuixBugs and ladder (and on SWE's one both-solved task with the re-run), cost 4 on QuixBugs and
ladder, refused steps 0, modelDrift 0, Jev share of wall 3.7 / 7.3 / 8.0 % (≤ 15 %); patchEmpty 5 vs 2 on SWE as run (2 vs 2 with
the re-run). Attribution (criterion 5) not evaluable: neither control arm ran.

What the transcripts say: GLM under `propose_fix` + `effort: low` returned 0 malformed samples in 228 (the baseline lost 27 % of
383 calls to `length` stops), but 77 samples hit the 20 s / 30 s deadline and 19 died of OpenRouter 429; 60 % of valid extra samples
duplicated sample 0. The seeds carried 15 of 22 cheap-test commits and all 6 SWE commits (4 rejected by the evaluator); the LLM
carried lis, wrap, shortest_path_length, grades, units and the second hunks of inventory, account, textstats. Every overfit is
the guard committing a test-fitting seed or a guarded LLM variant over the general candidate (wrap: Jev's Q17 chose the guarded
LLM patch 0.95 over the gold seed; textstats and django-15315 were committed at "max general 0.11–0.12"). On repositories the
SEEDS/RANK phase spends the run budget before LLM hunks are tested (sympy-17139 as run: 15 distinct LLM candidates, 0 tested),
the L2 reproduction can be narrower than the hidden test (sympy-15345: `Max` only, the test needs `Min` too) or unstable
(django-15315), and two runs ended `replan_stop` after three repeated `done partial` claims with most of the wall unused.
Jev is 74 % of llm-jev's cost (SWE: 405 requests / 23,396 questions as run). Peak RSS 4.49 GB on SWE (baseline ≈ 1 GB).

Recording gaps found: `generator.jsonl` and `steps.jsonl.usage.generator` hold only first-step LLM rounds (later rounds are
logged under `[step 1]` and unrecorded; `cost.generator` and `generatorCalls` in the record are complete); `synth.verify` in every
record is all zeros; `tasks.jsonl` carries `not_run` placeholders per started task; the CLI's condition list omits the two
attribution arms.

Verdict, one line: far faster (0.16–0.36× median wall) and cheaper (0.20–0.29× per solved) with more passes on the 22 cheap-test
tasks, but not more correct (5 overfits vs 0) and a loss on SWE-bench (1/6 vs 3/6) — the guard and the repository search order are
what to fix before the criterion can be re-measured on the full §10.3 set.

## 2026-09-21 — second head-to-head after the fix rounds (HEAD 066816f), with the `jev-off-tuned` attribution arm

Report: `experiments/results/llm-jev-headtohead-v2.md` (tool outputs `llm-jev-headtohead-v2.tool.md`, `.tuned-vs-baseline.tool.md`,
`.llmjev-vs-tuned.tool.md`); records `bench/results/llm-jev-v2-{smoke,quixbugs,ladder,swebench}` and
`bench/results/glm-jev-off-tuned-{quixbugs,ladder,swebench}`; frozen worktree `.claude/worktrees/llmjev-v2`, same 28 tasks,
generator, Jev id, limits and concurrency as the baseline and v1. Spend $0.389 of a $6 cap. llm-jev v2 passes **28/28** (baseline
19/28, tuned 22/28, v1 23/28; pooled discordant b = 9 / c = 0 vs the baseline, 6 / 0 vs tuned, 5 / 0 vs v1), correct-by-verdict
**20/22 with 2 overfits** on the cheap-test suites (v1 17/22 with 5; baseline 16/22 with 0; tuned 16/22 with 2) and **SWE-bench 6/6**
(baseline 3/6, tuned 4/6, v1 1/6) with every SWE commit an LLM hunk (v1: six seeds, four rejected); median wall 62 s pooled
(baseline 391 s, tuned 111 s, v1 80 s) — 0.39× / 0.14× / 0.09× the baseline per suite and 1.10× / 0.34× / 0.73× the tuned arm;
$0.144 total ($0.046 GLM + $0.099 Jev), $0.0051 per solved (baseline $0.0266, tuned $0.0110); RSS peak 2.9 GB on SWE (v1 4.5 GB).
Criterion (§1.3, absolute bars at n = 10/12/6): still **failed** on QuixBugs 1 (b − c = 3 < 8, p = 0.125) and 2 (Δ +2 < +8) and SWE 1
(b − c = 3 < 4) — all three unreachable by construction with this baseline — and **passed** on everything reachable: ladder 1–4
(correct 11 vs 9, overfits 1 ≤ 1), wall 3 and cost 4 on all three suites (SWE cost 0.12× where v1 was 2.43×), S1–S3, Jev share
3–9 %; criterion 5b: the tuned arm does not match llm-jev on pass or correctness and llm-jev is strictly better on ≥ 2 of
{correct, $ per solved, wall} on every suite (5a not evaluable, `llm-sieve` still not wired). What the transcripts show: the
unreleasable hold refused the lone narrow passers that v1 committed (wrap donor at general 0.06, sympy-15345 at 0.14 — the next
round's `Max`+`Min` candidates were arbitrated instead), LLM-first ordering on repositories ended class B (2–10 runs per commit,
`streamed batch ended on its first passer` ×5, 6 samples cancelled at commit), shipping/textstats are gold-identical LLM hunks,
GLM 0 malformed in 100 samples. Remaining: two overfits from the `fewest_special_cases` code rule deciding among guard-only clusters
with no LLM member present (`detect_cycle`; `stats` now `values.remove(mid)`, a strong overfit where v1's was exception-class only),
31 % of samples cut at the deadline (61 % on QuixBugs, all rows served by `Inceptron` — QuixBugs median 36 s vs v1's 33 s), and
sympy-11618 ending `replan_stop` after its fix against a judge that saw 43 pre-existing suite errors (evaluator pass). README's llm-jev
paragraph has no results rows and was left alone.

## 2026-09-21 — v2 leftovers round: the three classes the head-to-head left open (HEAD 8124e07, branch `v2-leftovers`)

Code, not a suite: the three items that §9 of `experiments/results/llm-jev-headtohead-v2.md` left open — class A′ (generality-by-code picking a
test-fitting seed when only seeds are in the clusters), class C′ (31 of 100 samples cut at the fixed 20 s / 30 s deadline) and class E′
(`sympy-11618` re-claiming `done partial` against 43 pre-existing collection errors) — are now built: the probe's majority decides an
all-seed split of equal support before any special-case count (`seedOnlySplit` / `probeMajorityCluster`, `CodeRule 'probe_majority'`,
`src/synth/search/guard.ts`); the per-sample deadline adapts as `clamp(2 × the running p90 of SERVED samples, the class default,
45 s cheap / 90 s repository)` and a provider whose served p90 is past the class default makes the run cap every further sample's
`reasoning: {maxTokens}` at 512, one-way (`LLM_DEADLINE_ADAPT`, `sampleDeadlineMs`, `providerSlow`, `src/synth/llm/source.ts`); and the
base commit's known failures travel on the claiming run's evidence, so the completion fact and the code judge compare against them
instead of against zero (`KnownFailuresEvidence`, `unexpectedFailures`, `src/loop/stages/complete.ts`, `judge.ts`; the count is measured
at the base commit and may only be lowered by a later re-baseline, `search/index.ts`). Design text: DESIGN §22.3 / §22.5 / §22.6,
LLM-JEV-DESIGN §4.8 rev 3, §6.2 rev 3, §6.6 rev 3.

Two live single-task runs, one per overfit v2 left behind, same generator (`z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`), Jev `jev-1.13.0`, limits and
evaluator as v2; $0.0017 spent across the two, each under its own $0.05 cap. Both pass and both end `complete` at step 2.

| task | run id | steps / wall / cost | guard decision | verdict vs v2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ladder `stats` | `20260922-034352-4n5ogwb3` | 2 · 11 s · $0.0010 | `the clusters split with no LLM member and equal support; committing template/guard_empty_raise at src/stats.py:22:insert — cluster_1 agrees with the passers' majority on the perturbed inputs (cluster_1 4/4, cluster_2 0/4; … +1c/+1l; … +0c/+0l) by code (no arbitration)` | **weak (exception-class-only) overfit, 2/111** differential inputs — v2's count-based pick was a **strong** overfit at 9/111 (`values.remove(mid)`: `median` mutated its argument, `AttributeError` on tuples) |
| QuixBugs `detect_cycle` | `20260922-034312-5vndocme` | 2 · 38 s · $0.0007 | `5 passers (0 held) in 2 behaviour clusters (probe 16 inputs, 5/5 signatures; cluster_1 3 members/support 2, cluster_2 2 members/support 1); cluster_1 holds the majority of the independent support; committing its representative llm/sample_0_0` | passes 6/6 reference cases with an **LLM hunk that differs from the reference on `detect_cycle(None)` alone** (1/500 random lists) — v2's `if not hare.successor.successor: break` differed on 126/500 |

Records `bench/results/llm-jev-v2-leftovers-{stats,detect-cycle}` (`verdicts.md` from `experiments/inspect/{ladder,quixbugs}-verdicts.mts`,
code only, no Jev). What the two runs show, exactly: `stats` is the class-A′ path itself — the probe's majority committed the +1c/+1l guard
(`if not ordered: raise ValueError("median of empty sequence")`) that `fewestSpecialCases` had rejected in favour of the +0c mutation, so the
committed patch now differs from gold only in the exception class two `None` inputs raise. `detect_cycle` never reached that rule: its LLM sample
was served in 6.7 s where v2's timed out at 20 s, so the set had an LLM member, `majorityCluster` fired on support 2 vs 1 and the LLM hunk
was committed — the shape class C′ said the fixed deadline had been costing, reached here without the deadline having to adapt at all.
Neither run exercised the adaptation (both samples inside the 20 s class default; the rounds record `deadline 20000 ms`) and neither is a
repository run, so class C′ under a slow provider and class E′ on
`sympy-11618` are **built but not yet re-measured live**; a full 28-task re-run is what would settle them.

What these two runs are **not**, stated so the record cannot be read as more than it is (and answering item C3 of
`experiments/results/llm-jev-headtohead-v2.verification.md`, which flagged these very directories while they were untracked): they are the
29th and 30th fits of two tasks that were graded during development, on a tree changed in response to their failure. They show that the
rule does what it was written to do on the two cases that motivated it — nothing about behaviour on a task nobody has inspected. The same
verification refutes "the only overfits are `detect_cycle` and `stats`" as a behavioural statement (ladder `units` diverges from gold on 10
of 20 string inputs, invisible to `LADDER_HARNESS`'s perturbations, so the cheap-test count is 19/22 with 3 divergences) and notes that SWE
"correctness" is defined as pass. Out-of-sample evidence for any of this needs the pre-registered §10.3 set — QuixBugs 40 twice, ladder 20
including the long tier, SWE 30 — which has never been run.
