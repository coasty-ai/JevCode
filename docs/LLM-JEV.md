# LLM-JEV — measurement log

The running log of the `llm-jev` mode (docs/LLM-JEV-DESIGN.md: the full engine with the Synthesizer, the generating LLM as a
candidate source inside it, Jev localising and arbitrating, shadow lanes verifying; bench arm `--conditions llm-jev`). One dated
entry per measurement, with the numbers, the run ids and the report they come from; the design doc holds the plan and the
criterion, `experiments/results/` holds the reports. Live results only — nothing here is projected.

## 2026-09-21 — first head-to-head against the GLM generator-only baseline (HEAD 626fc40)

Report: `experiments/results/llm-jev-headtohead.md` (tool output `llm-jev-headtohead.tool.md`, `.tool-rerun.md`); probes
`experiments/results/llm-jev-probes.md`; baseline `experiments/results/glm-jev-off-baseline.md`. Records under
`bench/results/llm-jev-{smoke,quixbugs,ladder,swebench,swebench-rerun}`. Frozen worktree `.claude/worktrees/llmjev-clean`,
generator `openrouter z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`, Jev `typesafe/jev-1.13-20260917` (wire id `jev-1.13.0`), same 28 tasks, limits and
concurrency as the baseline. Spend $0.406 of a $6 cap.

Pooled (28 paired tasks):

| arm | pass | correct-by-verdict (22 cheap-test) | wall median / mean | $ total (gen + Jev) | $ / task | $ / solved | steps mean | Jev requests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| jev-off (baseline) | 19/28 | 16/22, 0 overfit (+ 3/6 SWE) | 391 s / 480 s | $0.5062 ($0.5062 + $0) | $0.0181 | $0.0266 | 10.8 | 0 |
| jev-off-tuned | not run — `src/cli/args.ts:284 CONDITIONS` rejects the arm (exit 2, $0) | | | | | | | |
| llm-sieve | not run — `src/synth/index.ts:322` throws ConfigError (not wired) | | | | | | | |
| llm-jev, as run | 22/28 | 17/22, **5 overfit** (+ 0/6 SWE) | 80 s / 126 s | $0.2704 ($0.0695 + $0.2010) | $0.0097 | $0.0123 | 3.6 | 741 |
| llm-jev, 3 Jev-outage SWE runs replaced by the re-run | 23/28 | 17/22, 5 overfit (+ 1/6 SWE) | 80 s / 114 s | $0.3024 ($0.0715 + $0.2309) | $0.0108 | $0.0131 | 3.6 | 838 |

Per suite (llm-jev vs jev-off): QuixBugs 10/10 vs 7/10 (b 3, c 0), correct 8 vs 7 (overfit detect_cycle, wrap), wall median
33 s vs 93 s (0.36×, Wilcoxon p = 0.003), $ per solved 0.20×; ladder 12/12 vs 9/12 (b 3, c 0), correct 9 vs 9 (overfit shipping,
textstats, stats), wall median 47 s vs 289 s (0.16×, p < 0.001), $ per solved 0.29×; SWE 0/6 as run (3 runs killed by Jev HTTP
503/529 at 23:31–23:34 Z) and 1/6 with the re-run vs 3/6 (b 0, c 2: sympy-11618, django-15315; both: sympy-17139 at 6m02s / 3
steps vs 25m / 13 steps), $ per solved 2.43×.

Criterion (§1.3, absolute bars pre-registered for n = 40/20/30, applied verbatim at n = 10/12/6): **failed** — QuixBugs 1 (b − c = 3
< 8; p = 0.125) and 2 (Δ +1 < +8), ladder 2 (Δ 0 < +2; overfits 3 > 1), SWE 1 (c = 2, b = 0) and 4 ($ per solved 2.43× > 0.75×);
**passed** — ladder 1, wall 3 on QuixBugs and ladder (and on SWE's one both-solved task with the re-run), cost 4 on QuixBugs and
ladder, refused steps 0, modelDrift 0, Jev share of wall 3.7 / 7.3 / 8.0 % (≤ 15 %); patchEmpty 5 vs 2 on SWE as run (2 vs 2 with
the re-run). Attribution (criterion 5) not evaluable: neither control arm ran.

What the transcripts say: GLM under `propose_fix` + `effort: low` returned 0 malformed samples in 228 (the baseline lost 27 % of
383 calls to `length` stops), but 77 samples hit the 20 s / 30 s deadline and 19 died of OpenRouter 429; 60 % of valid extra samples
duplicated sample 0. The seeds carried 15 of 22 cheap-test commits and all 6 SWE commits (4 rejected by the evaluator); the LLM
carried lis, wrap, shortest_path_length, grades, units and the second hunks of inventory, account, textstats. Every overfit is
the guard committing a test-fitting seed or a guarded LLM variant over the general candidate (wrap: Jev's Q17 chose the guarded
LLM patch 0.95 over the gold seed; textstats and django-15315 were committed at "max general 0.11–0.12"). On repositories the
SEEDS/RANK phase spends the run budget before LLM hunks are tested (sympy-17139 as run: 15 distinct LLM candidates, 0 tested),
the L2 reproduction can be narrower than the hidden test (sympy-15345: `Max` only, the test needs `Min` too) or unstable
(django-15315), and two runs ended `replan_stop` after three repeated `done partial` claims with most of the wall unused.
Jev is 74 % of llm-jev's cost (SWE: 405 requests / 23,396 questions as run). Peak RSS 4.49 GB on SWE (baseline ≈ 1 GB).

Recording gaps found: `generator.jsonl` and `steps.jsonl.usage.generator` hold only first-step LLM rounds (later rounds are
logged under `[step 1]` and unrecorded; `cost.generator` and `generatorCalls` in the record are complete); `synth.verify` in every
record is all zeros; `tasks.jsonl` carries `not_run` placeholders per started task; the CLI's condition list omits the two
attribution arms.

Verdict, one line: far faster (0.16–0.36× median wall) and cheaper (0.20–0.29× per solved) with more passes on the 22 cheap-test
tasks, but not more correct (5 overfits vs 0) and a loss on SWE-bench (1/6 vs 3/6) — the guard and the repository search order are
what to fix before the criterion can be re-measured on the full §10.3 set.

## 2026-09-21 — second head-to-head after the fix rounds (HEAD 066816f), with the `jev-off-tuned` attribution arm

Report: `experiments/results/llm-jev-headtohead-v2.md` (tool outputs `llm-jev-headtohead-v2.tool.md`, `.tuned-vs-baseline.tool.md`,
`.llmjev-vs-tuned.tool.md`); records `bench/results/llm-jev-v2-{smoke,quixbugs,ladder,swebench}` and
`bench/results/glm-jev-off-tuned-{quixbugs,ladder,swebench}`; frozen worktree `.claude/worktrees/llmjev-v2`, same 28 tasks,
generator, Jev id, limits and concurrency as the baseline and v1. Spend $0.389 of a $6 cap. llm-jev v2 passes **28/28** (baseline
19/28, tuned 22/28, v1 23/28; pooled discordant b = 9 / c = 0 vs the baseline, 6 / 0 vs tuned, 5 / 0 vs v1), correct-by-verdict
**20/22 with 2 overfits** on the cheap-test suites (v1 17/22 with 5; baseline 16/22 with 0; tuned 16/22 with 2) and **SWE-bench 6/6**
(baseline 3/6, tuned 4/6, v1 1/6) with every SWE commit an LLM hunk (v1: six seeds, four rejected); median wall 62 s pooled
(baseline 391 s, tuned 111 s, v1 80 s) — 0.39× / 0.14× / 0.09× the baseline per suite and 1.10× / 0.34× / 0.73× the tuned arm;
$0.144 total ($0.046 GLM + $0.099 Jev), $0.0051 per solved (baseline $0.0266, tuned $0.0110); RSS peak 2.9 GB on SWE (v1 4.5 GB).
Criterion (§1.3, absolute bars at n = 10/12/6): still **failed** on QuixBugs 1 (b − c = 3 < 8, p = 0.125) and 2 (Δ +2 < +8) and SWE 1
(b − c = 3 < 4) — all three unreachable by construction with this baseline — and **passed** on everything reachable: ladder 1–4
(correct 11 vs 9, overfits 1 ≤ 1), wall 3 and cost 4 on all three suites (SWE cost 0.12× where v1 was 2.43×), S1–S3, Jev share
3–9 %; criterion 5b: the tuned arm does not match llm-jev on pass or correctness and llm-jev is strictly better on ≥ 2 of
{correct, $ per solved, wall} on every suite (5a not evaluable, `llm-sieve` still not wired). What the transcripts show: the
unreleasable hold refused the lone narrow passers that v1 committed (wrap donor at general 0.06, sympy-15345 at 0.14 — the next
round's `Max`+`Min` candidates were arbitrated instead), LLM-first ordering on repositories ended class B (2–10 runs per commit,
`streamed batch ended on its first passer` ×5, 6 samples cancelled at commit), shipping/textstats are gold-identical LLM hunks,
GLM 0 malformed in 100 samples. Remaining: two overfits from the `fewest_special_cases` code rule deciding among guard-only clusters
with no LLM member present (`detect_cycle`; `stats` now `values.remove(mid)`, a strong overfit where v1's was exception-class only),
31 % of samples cut at the deadline (61 % on QuixBugs, all rows served by `Inceptron` — QuixBugs median 36 s vs v1's 33 s), and
sympy-11618 ending `replan_stop` after its fix against a judge that saw 43 pre-existing suite errors (evaluator pass). README's llm-jev
paragraph has no results rows and was left alone.
